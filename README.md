# JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains all my daily practice work while learning JavaScript.

I'm learning the basics step by step, covering topics like:
- Variables
- Functions
- Loops
- DOM Manipulation
- Events
- and more...

I'm updating this repository regularly as I go. Suggestions are always welcome!  
🧠 I already know Python and OOP concepts, so learning JavaScript is faster and more interesting for me.
