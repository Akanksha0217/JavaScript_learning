# JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains all my daily practice work while learning JavaScript.

I'm learning the basics step by step, covering topics like:
- Variables
- Functions 
- Loops
- DOM Manipulation
- Events
- and more...

I'm updating this repository regularly as I go. Suggestions are always welcome!  
🧠 I already know Python and OOP concepts, so learning JavaScript is faster and more interesting for me.

### 🗓️ July 21, 2025
#### 🔍  explore Importance & Uses of JavaScript
   -   Enables **client-side interactivity**, such as:
       - DOM manipulation
       - Form validation
   - Plays a major role in **full-stack development** (e.g., with **Node.js**).
   - Forms the foundation of front-end frameworks like:
      - **React**, **Angular**, **Vue**

- Start working on new mini project  **Form Validator**

### 🗓️ July 22, 2025

- 💡 **Working on Mini Project: Form Validator**
  - Created a simple **HTML form** with input fields.
  - Added basic **CSS styling** to improve visual appearance.
  - Planning to apply **JavaScript validation logic** to:
    - Check for empty fields
    - Validate email format, password strength, etc.

### 🗓️ July 23, 2025

- 🧠 Solved various **array examples** to strengthen understanding.
- Learned and practiced array methods:
  - `sort()`, `delete`, `toString()`
- 🧩 Explored **destructuring**:
  - Array destructuring
  - Object destructuring
- ⭐ Tried a few **JavaScript star pattern problems** to build logic with loops.
- 
### 🗓️ July 24, 2025
- 👩‍💻 Practiced creating and using **classes**:
  - Defined constructors and methods inside classes.
  - Used `this` keyword and created multiple instances (objects).

  - `map()` – used for transforming array elements and returning a new array.
  - `forEach()` – used for performing side effects (e.g., printing) on each array element.
  - `for...of` – used to iterate over **iterables** like arrays, strings, etc.
  - `for...in` – used to iterate over **object keys** or enumerable properties.

 ### 🗓️ July 26, 2025

  - Accessed and updated nested values.
  - Used array methods like `map()`, `filter()` on objects in arrays.

### 🗓️ July 29, 2025
- 🔁 **Difference Between Hosting and Hoisting**:
  - **Hoisting** is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
  - **Hosting** refers to web hosting (completely unrelated); it's the process of storing website files on a server.
  - ✅ Hoisting = JavaScript concept; Hosting = Deployment/server concept.
- ✅ **Truthy and Falsy Values**:
  - **Truthy**: Values that evaluate to `true` in a boolean context. Examples: `"text"`, `1`, `true`, `[]`, `{}`
  - **Falsy**: Values that evaluate to `false`. Examples: `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `NaN`

### 🔄 Practice Examples (Steps Only):
- 🔁 **Reverse a String – Steps**:
  1. Take a string input.
  2. Break the string into individual characters.
  3. Reverse the order of the characters.
  4. Join the characters back into a string.
  5. Print or return the reversed string.
     
- 🔍 **Check for Palindrome – Steps**:
  1. Take a string input.
  2. Convert the string to lowercase and remove special characters (if needed).
  3. Reverse the string using similar steps from the previous task.
  4. Compare the original and reversed string.
  5. If they match, it's a palindrome.

- 🔢 **Count Vowels in a String – Steps**:
  1. Take a string input.
  2. Convert it to lowercase for uniformity.
  3. Loop through each character in the string.
  4. Check if the character is a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`).
  5. Keep a count of vowels found.
  6. Print or return the total count.
