# JavaScript Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains all my daily practice work while learning JavaScript.

I'm learning the basics step by step, covering topics like:
- Variables
- Functions
- Loops
- DOM Manipulation
- Events
- and more...

I'm updating this repository regularly as I go. Suggestions are always welcome!  
🧠 I already know Python and OOP concepts, so learning JavaScript is faster and more interesting for me.

- Understood the **structure of the DOM** (tree of nodes/elements).
- Learned how to **access and manipulate DOM elements** using JavaScript.

### 🗓️ July 16, 2025
- Practiced **DOM manipulation** techniques.
- Learned different ways to **select elements**:
  - By `id`, `class`, `tag name`, and using `querySelector()`.
- Worked with **element attributes**:
  - `getAttribute()`, `setAttribute()`, and `.attributes` property.

  - `innerText`, `innerHTML`, and `textContent`.

### 🗓️ July 17, 2025
- Practiced more advanced **DOM manipulation** techniques.
- Solved questions based on DOM element interactions.
- Explored **element styling** using JavaScript (`.style`).
- Learned how to **create elements dynamically** and:
  - `append()`, `prepend()`
  - `before()`, `after()`
  - `insertBefore()` and `appendChild()`
- Used `setAttribute()` and `getAttribute()` for working with element attributes.

### 🗓️ July 18, 2025
- Learned about **JavaScript events** and how to handle them.
- Explored the **event object** and different event **types**.
- Practiced using event types like:
  - `onclick`, `mouseover`, etc.
  - **Event handlers** (inline or assigned)
- Applied all event concepts to build a **Stone-Paper-Scissors game** using DOM + events.


### 🗓️ July 19, 2025
- Continued practicing all concepts learned so far.
- Focused more on **JavaScript events**:
  - Practiced using different event types (`click`, `mouseover`, etc.)
  - Applied `addEventListener()` on various elements
  - Strengthened understanding of how events interact with the DOM

### 🗓️ July 20, 2025
- Practiced using **event listeners** in JavaScript:
  - Used `addEventListener()` to attach events to DOM elements
  - Learned how to use `.addEventListener` with different event types
  - Explored how to **remove event listeners** using `removeEventListener()`
